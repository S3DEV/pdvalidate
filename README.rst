pdvalidate
==========


Introduction
------------

This ``pdvalidate`` package is a fork from ``pandas-validation`` (v0.5.0)
originally written by Markus Englund, and was enhanced to include 
additional functionality; specifically to return the validation error 
messages (from each test) to the caller for capture and logging purposes.

Great efforts have been made to retain the initial integrity of the 
original ``pandas-validation`` project, while adding some new features.
Additionally, the automated test suite has been maintained and updated
to test the new functionality.

Thank you Markus for your hard work on the **excellent** framework, and
for sharing it with us all!

**Please note:** The docs, GitHub and Travis CI **have not** yet been 
updated to reflect '``pdvalidate``' due to tight timescales around the 
project requiring this fork.  However, we plan to make these changes 
in the near future; hence the 0.6.0.dev2 versioning.
