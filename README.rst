pandas-validation / pdvalidate
==============================

Introduction
------------

This ``pdvalidate`` package is a fork from ``pandas-validation`` (v0.5.0)
originally written by Markus Englund, and was enhanced to include 
additional functionality; specifically to return the validation error 
messages (from each test) to the caller for capture and logging purposes.

Great efforts have been made to retain the initial integrity of the 
original ``pandas-validation`` project, while adding some new features.
Additionally, the automated test suite has been maintained and updated
to test the new functionality.

Thank you Markus for your hard work on the **excellent** framework, and
for sharing it with us all!

**Please note:** The remainder of this README, the docs, GitHub and 
Travis CI **have not** been updated to reflect '``pdvalidate``' due to 
tight timescales around the project requiring this fork.  However, we 
plan to make these changes in the near future; hence the 0.6.0.**dev01**
versioning.
