Installing pdvalidate
=====================

For most users, the easiest way is probably to install the latest version
from the wheel file located in the ``Install`` directory in your local
network.

.. code-block:: none

    $ pip install pdvalidate-x.x.x-py3-none-any.whl

The project is hosted at https://github.com/s3dev/pdvalidate and
can also be installed using git:

.. code-block:: none

    $ git clone https://github.com/s3dev/pdvalidate.git
    $ cd pdvalidate
    $ python setup.py install


.. tip::
    You may consider installing ``pdvalidate`` and its required Python
    packages within a virtual environment in order to avoid cluttering your
    system's Python path. See for example the environment management system
    `conda <http://conda.pydata.org>`_ or the package
    `virtualenv <https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/>`_.
