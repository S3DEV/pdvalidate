Installing pandas-validation
============================

For most users, the easiest way is probably to install the latest version
hosted on `PyPI <https://pypi.python.org/>`_:

.. code-block::

    $ pip install pandas-validation

The project is hosted at https://github.com/jmenglund/pandas-validation and
can also be installed using git:

.. code-block::

    $ git clone https://github.com/jmenglund/pandas-validation.git
    $ cd pandas-validation
    $ python setup.py install

.. tip::
   You may consider installing pandas-validation (and its required packages)
   within a virtual environment in order to avoid cluttering your system's
   Python path. See for example the package
   `virtualenv <https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/>`_.
